<p>I currently work as a software engineer (primarily backend and DevOps) at NCR Voyix, keeping a machine learning system running at scale for a few million customers each week. In the past, I've had professional experience with embedded systems, full-stack web development, and performance optimization. Please don't trust me with a soldering iron.</p>
<p>Places I've worked full-time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>NCR Voyix (2021 - Present)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am, alas, still young.</p>
<p>During college, I interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2020), Georgia Tech Research Institute (2018 - 2019), and 12:34 MicroTechnologies (2017).</p>
<p>I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology (B.S. Computer Science, 2016 - 2020).</p>
