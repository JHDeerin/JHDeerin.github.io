<p>Picking favorites is hard, and so is being exhaustive - so here's a random smorgasbord of things I like.</p>
<h2>Programming Blogs</h2>
<p>I once heard Seamus Heaney quote T.S. Eliot as saying that he first got his highs from reading different poems - and later, as he matured, he started picking favorite authors and extensively reading their work. When it comes to blogs, I'm definitely in the former category - there is no blog I've read every single post of. But here are some that I've found helpful or interesting, multiple times.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a> - Long gone dark, I feel like it's popular to pile on some of Joel's advice now (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210912095555/https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1413996396814823431">never rewriting</a> or <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/30/top-five-wrong-reasons-you-dont-have-testers">hiring testers</a>), but I'm immensely grateful I was told to read Joel in my spare time during my first internship. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code">The Joel Test</a>, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Leaky Abstractions</a>, and more are classic, well-written articles that gave me a good start as a new developer.</li>
    <li><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">Coding Horror</a> - Joel's literal partner-in-crime (they co-founded Stack Overflow), I don't remember any specific blog post by Jeff Atwood, but the sum total of reading a bunch of them was "oh, this is the stuff <em>professional</em> programmers do." <a href="https://gist.github.com/tssm/7789984">Grab a handful</a> and read, being aware that here be opinions - like all of these, I guess.</li>
    <li><a href="http://danluu.com/">Dan Luu</a> - A terrible-looking website with some excellent, thoughtful, usually very-long posts from a Google/Twitter engineer, often challenging conventional wisdom with data. <a href="https://danluu.com/why-benchmark/">Benchmarking is underrated</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">I could do that in a weekend!</a>, and <a href="https://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/">We only hire the trendiest</a> are some favorites of mine. A good counter-balance to the "conventional" wisdom of the above.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ericsink.com/index.html">Erik Sink</a> - An old Microsoft alum blog I found via praise from Dan Luu. I'm coming to him late, but <a href="https://ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html">Developers, Not Programmers</a> and <a href="https://ericsink.com/Marketing_for_Geeks.html">Marketing for Geeks</a> are great reminders that the best programmers don't just write code - they solve problems, with code (usually).</li>
    <li><a href="http://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a> - A wide-ranging (and still active!) blog on a ton of topics, from the gnarliest Unix CLI bugs to how to ask good questions - Julia seems to focus on explaining confusing topics as clearly as possible. I also love her comics/zines, too - <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging-guide/">The Pocket Guide to Debugging</a> and <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/wizard/">So you want to be a wizard</a> are the single best debugging guides I've read (and hands-down the most fun). If you have 5 minutes, read <a href="https://wizardzines.com/images/debugging-manifesto.pdf">a debugging manifesto</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/">Marc Brooker</a> - Another Dan Luu recommendation, an AWS engineer who posts a mix of distributed system stuff and general career advice. Being a sane-minded individual who's rightly scared of distributed systems theory, I've gravitated towards the career advice. <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/10/19/big-changes.html">Getting Big Things Done</a> and <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/02/06/time.html">How Do You Spend Your Time?</a> are both worthwhile. Although, okay, on the technical side <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/01/02/why-distributed.html">Why do we need distributed systems?</a> got through even my thick skull.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/">Ben Kuhn</a> - A startup-CTO-turned-Anthropic-manager who tends to post a lot of "life advice for engineers" stuff (along with having some pretty great lists of <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">programming</a> <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/blogroll/">blogs</a> I occasionally nip at). I haven't read most of it (and don't agree with everything), but it's always thoughtful. <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/pjm/">How I've run major projects</a>, <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/">In defense of blub studies</a>, and <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/">Why and how to write things on the Internet</a> were all worth reading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I also like things that are not programming blogs, I promise</h2>

However, it is late, and uploading the thoughts of one's brain to the Internet is very long - so good night for now.
