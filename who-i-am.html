<p>Hey, I'm Jake. I live in Atlanta, Georgia, but grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (yes, the one with all the Amish). I'm a garden-variety Southern Baptist Christian and a nerd-flavored male humanoid. I promise I come in peace.</p>
<p>If you come not in peace, but for war, please see my <a href="career-stuff.html">Career Stuff</a>. (Actual hiring managers: that was a joke. Sorry. I make a lot of those.)</p>
<p>If you'd like, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:2016deerinjo@gmail.com">2016deerinjo@gmail.com</a>, where I will respond with - well, not exactly alacrity, but I promise to read what you send. I'm not popular enough to have an excuse.</p>
<p>Glad to have you here - stay as long as you like, until your travels take you further on.</p>
