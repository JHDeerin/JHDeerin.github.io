                <p>Joseph "Jake" H. Deerin was born on February 5<sup>th</sup>, 1998, in the middle of a Pennsylvania snowstorm he can't quite remember. At the age of 8, he decided he was going to learn how computers worked to impress his friends. He failed. At first. Horribly.</p>
                <p>After revisiting programming through his classes in high school, Jake has been consistently working with code since 2013. In high school, Jake won multiple region-level awards while leading the Video Game Design team for Manheim Township's <a href="http://lancasteronline.com/news/tsa-region-competition/image_4c4ab224-cd0b-11e5-9b01-cff136977e9a.html">Technology Student Association</a>. Through TSA, he additionally competed at the state level in Computer Systems Troubleshooting, Digital Video Production, and Debating Technology Issues, the last of which he won as the 2016 Pennsylvania State Champion, establishing the depth of his acumen as well as his utter lack of a social life. He concurrently cemented his status as the school's ultra-nerd by serving as captain of the Manheim Township <a href="http://mtquizbowl.net/About_Us.html">Quiz Bowl team</a> throughout his Junior and Senior years, having the honor of leading the team to a <a href="https://www.naqt.com/stats/team-performance.jsp?team_id=93205&playoffs=true">13<sup>th</sup>-place finish</a> at the 2016 High School National Championship and of <a href="https://twitter.com/manheimtownship/status/574939992646098944">twice</a> <a href="https://gpqb.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/announcement-pa-nasat-team-selections/">representing</a> Pennsylvania at the National All-Star Academic Tournament.</p>
                <p>He is a proud Eagle Scout, being awarded the honor by Troop 99 in the spring of 2016, as well as a National Honor Society member and a National Merit Scholarship finalist.</p>
                <p>Jake is currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in Atlanta, Georgia, where he is involved with both the <a href="http://www.vgdev.org">VGDev Game Development club</a> and the <a href="http://quizbowl.gtorg.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Academic Team</a>. When not at his desk or helping out at VGDev, he can usually be found in a corner somewhere, curled up with a good book, a cup of tea, or, of course, his laptop. In the world of computer science, Jake is particularly interested in artificial intelligence, media design, and human-computer interaction. </p>
