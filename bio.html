                <p>Joseph "Jake" H. Deerin was born on February 5<sup>th</sup>, 1998, in the middle of a Pennsylvania snowstorm he can't quite remember. At the age of 8, he decided he was going to learn how computers worked to impress his friends. He failed. At first. Horribly.</p>
                <p>After revisiting programming through his classes in high school, Jake has been consistently working with code since 2013. In high school, Jake won multiple region-level awards while leading the Video Game Design team for Manheim Township's <a href="http://www.tsaweb.org/">Technology Student Association</a>. He concurrently cemented his status as the school's ultra-nerd by serving as captain of the Manheim Township Quiz Bowl team throughout his Junior and Senior years, having the honor of leading the team to a <a href="https://www.naqt.com/stats/team-performance.jsp?team_id=93205&playoffs=true">13<sup>th</sup>-place finish</a> at the 2016 High School National Championship and of <a href="https://gpqb.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/announcement-pa-nasat-team-selections/">twice</a> <a href="https://gpqb.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/announcement-pa-nasat-team-selections/">representing</a> Pennsylvania at the National All-Star Academic Tournament.</p>
                <p>Through the Technology Student Association, he additionally competed at the state level in Computer Systems Troubleshooting, Digital Video Production, and Debating Technology Issues, the last of which he and teammate Nicholas Ong won as the 2016 Pennsylvania State Champions, establishing the dominance of his acumen as well as his utter lack of a social life.</p>
                <p>He is a proud Eagle Scout, being awarded the honor by Troop 99 in the spring of 2016, as well as a National Honor Society member and a National Merit Scholarship finalist.</p>
                <p>Jake is currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. When not at his desk or helping out at VGDev, he can usually be found in a corner somewhere, curled up with a good book, a cup of tea, or, of course, his laptop.</p>
