# JHDeerin.github.io

My personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages. Check it out! https://jhdeerin.github.io

## Developing

You'll need to run the site locally on a web server (due to my liberal use of absolute paths) - sorry. But that shouldn't be too hard:

```bash
npm install -g http-server  # install a web server
http-server # start the server; open one of the links it gives in your browser
```

Deploy the site by pushing changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

## Contributing

Noticed an issue on my website (grammatical, programmatical, or mineral)? Have a neat idea that you've kindly decided to share with me? That's great! Please open a new issue with your concerns and I'll do my utmost to address them as soon as possible.

And of course, if you've taken the time to do this: thank you!
