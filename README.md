Noticed an issue on my website (grammatical, programmatical, or mineral)? Have
a neat idea that you've kindly decided to share with me? That's great! Please
open a new issue with your concerns and I'll do my utmost to address them as
soon as possible.

And of course, if you've taken the time to do this: *thank you!*
