## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

Deploy the build by moving the output `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
