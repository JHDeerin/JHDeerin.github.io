                <li> Since the russian people have only ever seen ice, the
                    presence of water in its liquid form will terrify them into
                    submission </li>
                <li> This is <em>my</em> fanfic, impotent reader </li>

                <dt> Putin </dt>
                <dd> The barechested tyranical dictator of Russia. He rules
                    with an iron fist from his ursine mount deep within the
                    bear caves under the Kremlin. Not to be trifled with.
                    Except in memes. </dd>
                <dt> Ocean </dt>
                <dd> So many million gallons of cold water, or an obstacle,
                    ally, friend and foe to man that has seen the scars of years
                    and borne glories and terrors alike upon her back. Take
                    your pick. </dd>
