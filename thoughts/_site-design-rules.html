<h2>Rules for this Site</h2>

<h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Be true, be good, be as beautiful as you can make it - <a href="https://www.esv.org/verses/Philippians+4:8/#">Phil. 4:8</a></li>
    <li>If Jesus came here, would he be welcome? Would he approve?</li>
    <li>If your worst enemy came here, would he feel welcome? Would he approve? <em>Would he be right?</em></li>
    <li>If this were the only thing someone saw of you - not a deep friend, just a stranger passing by - would that be alright?</li>
    <li>What would my mom say?</li>
    <li>Do you like it?</li>
    <li>Speak when you have something to say, not because you have to say something. The world has and will get along fine with your mouth closed.</li>
    <li>Beware trends. If it's younger than 5 years, will it still be here in 5 more? Then again, someone invented concrete one day.</li>
    <li>Be clear - enough so your mistakes are obvious.</li>
    <li>Minimize effort. Whatever makes this easiest to add to, maintain, and get started, do that. When in doubt, just get started. Make a mess and clean it up later - and don't come back until you've had fun. Doing this in public is optional.</li>
    <li>As a large man said, an inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specifics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It should load on a 10-year old phone lickety-split. That should guide technology decisions (e.g. prefer JPEG over WEBP), but don't fuss over this too much for CSS features if it'd complicate lots of things.</li>
    <li>Pages should really all be &lt250kb.</li>
    <li>Images have to be under 50kb.</li>
    <li>Speak in first person. They're a guest here, you're the host.</li>
    <li>Content over flashiness, unless the flashiness is really, really fun and the content isn't high-gravity matter.</li>
    <li>Be a little weird, but still make the site easily usable. Don't use a conventional navbar, but make sure people can get around. Play with <span style="color: var(--flexoki-green-400)">c<span style="color: var(--flexoki-cyan-400)">o<span style="color: var(--flexoki-blue-400)">l</span>o</span>r</span>, but don't make contrast impossible.</li>
    <li><a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki">Flexoki</a> is the color scheme until further notice.</li>
    <li>Prefer instant interaction over fades for anything vaguely usable. Unless the fun animation is the whole point of why someone would look at or click on the thing, just do what they want immediately.</li>
    <li>The whole site should work without Javascript. A fun Javascript page every now and then is alright, but the bulk of the site and especially the main sections should work without it.</li>
    <li>When adding thoughts: they should be HTML pages in the <i>thoughts</i> folder. Unpublished and/or in-progress thoughts should be prefixed with a "_" in the filename. When published, prefix them with a non-padded number (e.g. "0", "1", "11", "451", etc.) in ascending order of publication, and give them a date in the "thoughts.html" link. All thoughts should have page titles that match their actual titles, and be linked to as such.</li>
    <li>Images for a page should go in the "assets/images" folder, and be named in a flat structure according to the page they're associated with, without any order prefixes, and with underscores used to replace folder divisions. For example, an image for "thoughts/0_website-redesign-2025.html" should be called "assets/images/thoughts_website-redesign-2025_..."</li>
    <li>Try to make simple tools useful. Design paths and structures so they can be easily find-and-replaced.</li>
</ul>
