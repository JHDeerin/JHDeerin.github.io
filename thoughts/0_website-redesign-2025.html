<h2>Yet Another Website Redesign</h2>

<p>After about 5-ish years, I decided to redesign my website - again. A brief history is in order, I think:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>2016</b> - As a freshman in college, a class tells me that I have to attend the fall career fair, bring a resume, and have a personal website ready-to-go for it. I learn that GitHub Pages is a free option and think it would be cool to make my website from scratch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189">learning HTML</a> as I go. I follow the grading rubric about required pages word for word. I have never heard of Javascript, frameworks, or templates.</p>
        <p>It was, needless to say, a masterpiece: <img src="/assets/images/thoughts_website-redesign-2025_2016-website.jpg" alt="an image of my unimpressive 2016 website homepage"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>2020</b> - By my final semester, I've had a few internships and club projects under my belt, including a fresh stint making internal tooling pages with Vue. For my last career fair, I decide to rewrite my site in Vue to be more maintainable, and to redesign it as a single-page site while I'm at it.</p>
        <p>It was, needless to say, a masterpiece: <img src="/assets/images/thoughts_website-redesign-2025_2020-website.jpg" alt="an image of my unimpressive 2020 website homepage"></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>2023</b> - Whilst a working backend dev who's barely touched HTML in years, I see that Svelte is at the top of all the Stack Overflow polls, and decide I want to give it a try by porting my existing website to it (without other changes). This is simultaneously really frustrating (getting the 3-year old Vue build working after I foolishly updated all dependencies took days, SvelteKit added a bunch of frameworky stuff I didn't expect, etc.) and boringly easy (after all the setup, the Vue and Svelte component structure was nearly identical, and porting my pages was straightforward).</p>
        <p>I finish the update, then promptly don't use it and lose it (i.e. all my Svelte knowledge).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>So why, 2 years later, am I updating my site - with, needless to say, another masterpiece?</p>
<p>The main reasons: I wanted my website to be more personal (and less "please give me a job" focused), inspiration from the "small web" community struck, and I was thinking of - very occasionally - blogging.</p>
<p>These reasons are related, but the 2nd one is what actually got me to do something. I was reading Parimal Satyal's <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web">Rediscovering the Small Web</a> (there is, apparently, <a href="https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun">a whole genre</a> of "make the internet fun again" blogs), and the idea of making a small website - just plain HTML and CSS, no frameworks to learn or keep updated - seemed really fun to me. No keeping up with the frameworks! Your own small space to be weird!</p>
<p>This also jibed with my feeling that this website wasn't really representative of me, personally, anymore, despite being a "personal website." I had created it to get a job in my early twenties, and I wanted it to be more generally "Jake's website", rather than "Jake's really-would-like-to-be-employed website." It felt awkward to have my site structure still follow a campus career center rubric from almost a decade ago, and to me the old site's tone felt like I was trying too hard to be liked - which, y'know, I was. I'd been mildly uncomfortable with that for awhile, but not enough to do anything about it other than feel more-than-usually awkward when sharing the link. Satyal's "just write something in HTML, screw the frameworks" call finally pushed me over the edge - or lowered the activation energy - some metaphor like that.</p>
<p>Oh, and blogging. This was a smaller reason, one tied into the personalization motive, and one I waffled on. The Internet has enough opinions out there already, by people smarter and wiser than me - what do I have to add besides noise? Isn't it vain to throw your thoughts out, expecting to be read? But, for now, I've decided go for it, for several reasons:
<ol>
    <li>Multiple people I've read and/or know say they blog to refine their own thoughts in writing, which seems worthwhile to me - a chance to practice writing, and a chance to think better.</li>
    <li>I expect no one but IRL friends (and the occasional Russian bot) to read this - which is good, actually. It takes the pressure off, and means I don't have to worry (as much) about posting out of pride.</li>
    <li>It seems like a nice opportunity to share ideas with friends, and get feedback on them.</li>
    <li>It's a place for me to record my own thoughts for reference later.</li>
    <li>I was convinced <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#but-i-dont-have-anything-original-to-say-and-i-would-be-just-repeating-things-said-elsewhere-on-the-internet">you don't have to be original on the Internet to be helpful.</a></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Ironically, design-wise I've ended up going with a kinda-generic minimalist vibe, despite the small-web inspiration. That came out of a combination of me wanting to minimize page size (but <a href="https://danluu.com/octopress-speedup/">not as much as Dan Luu</a>), having no artistic talent, and actually (sigh) liking minimalist designs, despite them being everywhere these days. I've also always appreciated readability, and really liked Steph Ango's <a href="https://stephango.com/flexoki">Flexoki</a> theme, so I shamelessly copied from him.</p>

<p>So, that's it - welcome to the new site. May it live long and prosper, or, failing that, be a stepping stone on to greater things.</p>
